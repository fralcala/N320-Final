### Key Takeaways

- This means planning, dividing responsibilities, and communicating clearly throughout the project.
- We also want to gain experience deploying a live website that looks clean, is easy to navigate, and works smoothly.
- By the end, we hope to better understand how real-world web development teams collaborate and build professional web applications.
