              Nicknamed the "hell planet," <strong>55 Cancri e</strong> — formally named <em>Janssen</em> — is an ultra-hot super-Earth that orbits so close to its star that a year lasts just <strong>17.5 hours</strong>. The planet is believed to be tidally locked, meaning one side always faces the star while the other remains in darkness.

            <p>
              Temperatures on the day side can reach up to <strong>2,700°C (4,900°F)</strong>, hot enough to melt rock. Scientists think the planet’s surface might be a massive lava ocean, constantly boiling under the intense starlight.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope suggest that 55 Cancri e may have a dynamic atmosphere composed of volcanic gases like carbon monoxide. Its extreme environment and possible carbon-rich core even sparked speculation that the planet might contain large amounts of <strong>diamond</strong>.

            <h3>Extreme Features of 55 Cancri e</h3>
            <p>
              55 Cancri e challenges everything we know about rocky exoplanets. It is nearly twice the size of Earth but has eight times its mass, classifying it as a <strong>super-Earth</strong>. Its orbit is incredibly tight — the planet is just <strong>1.4 million miles</strong> from its host star, much closer than Mercury is to our Sun.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              The planet likely has <strong>no seasons</strong> due to its tidal lock, with one hemisphere permanently exposed to its star. This leads to an enormous temperature contrast between the day and night sides. It's so hot that minerals may vaporize and condense like rain on the cooler side.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Scientists have debated whether 55 Cancri e has an atmosphere or a bare rock surface. Thanks to NASA’s Webb Telescope, recent findings suggest that volcanic activity could be releasing gases into a thin, constantly changing atmosphere. This adds to the planet's mystique — is it a hellish wasteland, or a dynamic lava world with exotic weather?
