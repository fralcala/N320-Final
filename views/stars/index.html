      <h1>Stars</h1>
      <h3>What are Stars?</h3>
      <p>
        A star is a bright sphere of plasma held together by it's own gravity.
        Many stars are visible in the night sky and they are even categorized
        into different<span><a>constellations and asterisms.</a></span> Many of
        the brightest stars today have names and the observable universe has
        anywhere between 10^22 to 10^24 stars. Only about 4000 stars are visible
        to us at night without any magnification.

      <h3>Observations about Stars</h3>
      <p>
        Stars have been important to civilizations throughout the world. They
        have been part of religious practices, divination rituals, mythology,
        used for celestial navigation and orientation, to mark the passage of
        seasons, and to define calendars.

        Early astronomers recognized a difference between "fixed stars", whose
        position on the celestial sphere does not change, and "wandering stars"
        (planets), which move noticeably relative to the fixed stars over days
        or weeks. Many ancient astronomers believed that the stars were
        permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable.
        By convention, astronomers grouped prominent stars into asterisms and
        constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the
        inferred position of the Sun.

        The oldest accurately dated star chart was the result of ancient
        Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC. The earliest known star catalogues were
        compiled by the ancient Babylonian astronomers of Mesopotamia in the
        late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (c. 1531 BC – c. 1155
        BC).
