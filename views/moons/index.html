        <h2>What are moons?</h2>
        <p>
          Moons are natural satellites — objects that orbit planets or other
          celestial bodies. Most planets in our solar system have at least one
          moon, and some have dozens. Even dwarf planets like Pluto have moons!
        </p>
        <h2>How do moons form?</h2>
        <p>
          Moons form in a few different ways. Some moons are created at the same
          time as their planet, forming from the same cloud of gas and dust in
          space. Others are captured later, when a planet's gravity pulls in a
          passing asteroid or object. A third way happens when a large collision
          smashes into a planet, throwing debris into space that eventually
          clumps together to form a moon. Earth's Moon likely formed this way,
          after a massive impact with a Mars-sized object billions of years ago.

            <h2>Moons in our solar system</h2>
            <p>
              There are hundreds of moons in our solar system, and they come in
              all shapes and sizes. Earth has just one large moon, but other
              planets have many. Jupiter has more than 90 moons, including
              Ganymede, the largest moon in the solar system. Saturn also has
              dozens of moons, with Titan being one of the most interesting
              because it has thick clouds and lakes of liquid methane. Mars has
              two tiny, potato-shaped moons called Phobos and Deimos. Even dwarf
              planets like Pluto have moons — Pluto's largest moon, Charon, is
              so big that it makes Pluto wobble as they orbit each other. Some
              moons are rocky, some are icy, and a few may even have oceans
              hidden under their surfaces, making them exciting places to study
              in the search for life.
