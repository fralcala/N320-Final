          <h2>What is a Planet?</h2>
          
          <p>According to the current definition by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is a celestial body that:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>Orbits the Sun.</li>
            <li>Is massive enough for its own gravity to make it nearly round in shape.</li>
            <li>Has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit of other objects.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>In 2006, this definition led to a major change in our understanding of the solar system, as Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a "dwarf planet." This decision was based on the fact that Pluto has not cleared its orbital neighborhood of other debris.</p>
      
          <p>Planets are divided into two broad types based on their compositions: terrestrial (rocky) planets and gas giants. The terrestrial planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are dense and rocky, while the gas giants—Jupiter and Saturn—and the ice giants—Uranus and Neptune—are composed mostly of gases and ices.</p>
      
          <p>As technology advances, astronomers continue to discover thousands of exoplanets—planets orbiting other stars beyond our solar system. These findings challenge our understanding of planet formation and diversity, and suggest that planetary systems are common in our galaxy.</p>
      
          <p>Our definition of a planet may continue to evolve as new discoveries are made and as our exploration of the universe progresses.</p>

            <h2>Our Solar System</h2>
            
            <p>Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with two major arms, and two minor arms. Our Sun is in a small, partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms. Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</p>

          <h3>Planets of the Solar System</h3>
          <p>The planets of our solar system are traditionally divided into two groups based on their location and characteristics:</p>
      
          <h4>Inner Solar System</h4>
          <p>The inner solar system contains the four terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are primarily composed of rock and metal, have solid surfaces, and are located closer to the Sun.</p>
      
          <h4>Outer Solar System</h4>
          <p>The outer solar system includes the gas giants and ice giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are much larger than the terrestrial planets and are composed mostly of hydrogen, helium, and ices such as water, ammonia, and methane.</p>

          <h2>Strangest Planets Discovered</h2>
          <p >
            Beyond our solar system, astronomers have discovered thousands of exoplanets. Among them, some stand out as truly bizarre worlds—raining glass, burning with diamond crusts, or even being consumed by their own stars. Here are a few of the strangest planets ever found.
