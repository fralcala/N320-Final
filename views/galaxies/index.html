          <h2>What is a Galaxy?</h2>

          <p>
            A galaxy is a massive system of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter
            bound together by gravity. Galaxies are the fundamental building
            blocks of the universe, and they come in a variety of shapes, sizes,
            and compositions.
          </p>
          <p>There are three main types of galaxies based on their shape:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Spiral galaxies, like our own Milky Way, have a flat, rotating
              disk with spiral arms and a central bulge.
            </li>
            <li>
              Elliptical galaxies range from nearly spherical to elongated ovals
              and generally contain older stars with less gas and dust.
            </li>
            <li>
              Irregular galaxies lack a clear shape and are often chaotic in
              appearance, sometimes due to past collisions or interactions.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Galaxies can contain millions to trillions of stars, along with
            planetary systems, star clusters, nebulae, and supermassive black
            holes at their centers. The Milky Way, for example, contains over
            100 billion stars and a black hole estimated to be about 4 million
            times the mass of our Sun.
          </p>

          <p>
            Galaxies are not isolated—they exist in groups and clusters, and
            even larger structures called superclusters. They can collide and
            merge over billions of years, leading to dramatic changes in their
            structure and star formation.
          </p>

          <p>
            As telescopes and observational technology improve, astronomers
            continue to discover more about the origins, evolution, and
            diversity of galaxies. These discoveries help us better understand
            the large-scale structure of the universe and our place within it.

            <h2>Galaxies in the Universe</h2>

            <p>
              Galaxies are vast collections of stars, gas, dust, and dark matter
              held together by gravity. They are the grand cities of the cosmos,
              each containing millions to trillions of stars. There are
              estimated to be over two trillion galaxies in the observable
              universe, ranging from small dwarf galaxies to giant ellipticals
              that span hundreds of thousands of light-years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a barred spiral galaxy about
              100,000 light-years in diameter. It has several arms spiraling out
              from its center, where a supermassive black hole resides. The
              Milky Way contains over 100 billion stars, including our Sun, and
              is part of a small group of galaxies called the Local Group.
            </p>
            <p>
              Galaxies are not static—they move, interact, and sometimes
              collide. In about 4 billion years, the Milky Way is expected to
              merge with its neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, creating a new,
              larger galaxy. These cosmic interactions shape the structure and
              evolution of galaxies over billions of years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Galaxies are essential to understanding the universe’s history and
              future. By studying their formation, movement, and composition,
              astronomers gain insight into how the universe has evolved since
              the Big Bang.
